<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was made for an **Apple Developer Academy - IFCE** Individual Challenge, using **Challenge Based Learning** (CBL) framework.

The purpose of the app is to make it easier to discover new Villagers and their characteristics, such as personality and birthday. You can also favorite villagers and tag which villagers are currently on your island.

This project is still under development. Core data is currently being implemented to persist data.
